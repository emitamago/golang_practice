### About this projects
- This is a personal project to learn Go language.
- Following Udemy Go tutorial for instruction.

### Motive
I have learn couple dynamic typed language such as Javascript and Python. I learned some benefit of those languages but 
also limitations. 

In order to understand those pros and cons, I thought it is very important to understand the other type of languages.
So I decided to learn Go language to deepen my understading differerence between them.

I will add more projects as I learn more

Thank you!
